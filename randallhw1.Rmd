#Peer-graded Assignment: R Markdown and Leaflet

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. 

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

Here I will map the locations of my summer vacation. I can't wait to get here!

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() 
my_map <- my_map %>% addMarkers(lat=52.903654, lng= -118.097318, popup="My 2019 vacation destination #1, Jasper, Alberta, Canada")

my_map <- my_map %>% addMarkers(lat=51.083392, lng= -115.341042, popup="My 2019 vacation destination #2, Canmore, Alberta, Canada")
my_map
```
